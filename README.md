# Xamarin Schedule Getting Started
## Xamarin Forms Scheduler
The [Xamarin Scheduler control](https://www.syncfusion.com/xamarin-ui-controls/xamarin-scheduler?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=xamarin-scheduler-github-samples) is an event calendar that is used to schedule and manage appointments through an intuitive user interface, similar to the native device calendar. Different view modes are supported: day, week, work week, month, and timeline.
